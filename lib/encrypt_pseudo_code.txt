grab random key number
  - pull from key_gen file (must require it at top of encrypt file)
  - make a new instance of key generation (key_generator.new)
  -

grab offset number
 - combine file to key_gen file?
 - if not, do the same as grab random key number

grab message
 - where is this coming from?
 - input = @file: File.read('./message.txt' pathname (root folder))

change message input from string to array for each element
 - .chars (gives an array of characters)

add offset and rotation to get a number
 - set up something that returns the one number instead of two (this makes the shift easier)

shift letter by appropriate number of rotations and offsets
 - will need to map through the array and charcter map to determine correct ending point
 - need to push the final landing spot to new array

determine correct starting point for rotations and offsets
 -

iterate through entire message and place in local variable

turn message into a string

return encrypted message in encrypted format
