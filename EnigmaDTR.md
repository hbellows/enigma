Project: Enigma

Group Member Names:Erik Schneider and Harper Bellows

Project Expectations: What does each group member hope to get out of this project? A little farther in our skill set together. The longterm goal would be to solve but the short term goal is to get farther than last project.

Goals and expectations: This is a combined 5 day process. Each day is to be met with more progress than the last.

Team strengths: Harmony together. Similar personality styles and skill level matches.

How to overcome obstacles: To use our resources effectively to overcome our lack of skill and knowledge.

Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually?): Remote on the weekend and in person on the weekdays.

Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open?): Communicating daily during the day is very organic. On the weekends, we’ll do it remotely using the Slack remote calls and screen share. Mother’s Day will be scheduled as necessary after the festivities.

Abilities Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement): We are both at the same spot and skill level. We will be looking to use our outside resources as much as we can to help improve our levels.

Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?): We’ll work the majority of more difficult problems together. Once we can break the problem down to more simple problems, we will split the workload evenly.

Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests): The more we can push, the better practice it will be for us. We will strive to commit and push as much as we can. (and is reasonable).

Expectations for giving and receiving feedback: Open communication from the start. Constructive feedback. (Harmony strenghts don’t like criticism.) We are both harmony strenghts.

Agenda to discuss project launch:

Ideas: need to whiteboard project, turn whiteboard into deliverables, turn deliverables into code (and tests).

Tools: (slack channel capabilities (screen share), atom, github, outside resources, inside resources
